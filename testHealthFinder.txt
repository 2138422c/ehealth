If plaque builds up on your teeth, it can cause cavities or gum disease.Brush your teeth with fluoride toothpaste twice a day. Brush after breakfast and before bed.Floss between your teeth every day. If flossing is hard for you, ask a dentist about using a special brush or pick instead.Watch for changes in your mouth.Your risk of getting oral cancer increases as you get older. If you see any changes in your mouth, it&rsquo;s important to get them checked out.See a doctor or dentist if you have any of these symptoms for more than 2 weeks:A spot in your mouth, lip, or throat that feels uncomfortable or soreA new lump or thick area in your mouth, lip, or throatA white or red patch in your mouthDifficulty chewing, swallowing, or moving your jaw or tongueNumbness or swelling in your mouthPain in one ear without hearing lossSee the dentist regularly for a checkup and cleaning.There&rsquo;s no single rule for how often people need to see the dentist &ndash; it varies from person to person. The next time you get a checkup and cleaning, ask your dentist how often you need to come in.Keep in mind that Medicare doesn&rsquo;t pay for routine dental care. You may want to get private dental insurance.For help finding low-cost dental care, visit http://www.nidcr.nih.gov/OralHealth/PopularPublications/FindingLowCostDentalCare.Talk to your doctor about dry mouth.Dry mouth means not having enough saliva (spit) to keep your mouth wet.

It can also happen if you have certain health problems (like diabetes) or if you are getting chemotherapy or radiation (treatment for cancer).If you have dry mouth, you don&rsquo;t have to live with it. Talk with your doctor or dentist and ask what you can do.Practice healthy habits.Eat healthy&nbsp;and cut down on sugary foods and drinks.
