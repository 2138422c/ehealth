S'Pain is a feeling triggered in the nervous system. Pain may be sharp or dull.  It may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your back, abdomen or chest or you may feel pain all over, such as when your muscles ache from the flu.Pain can be helpful in diagnosing a problem.  Without pain, you might seriously hurt yourself without knowing it, or you might not realize you have a medical problem that needs treatment.  Once you take care of the problem, pain usually goes away.  However, sometimes pain goes on for weeks, months or even years.  This is called chronic pain.  Sometimes chronic pain is due to an ongoing cause, such as cancer or arthritis. Sometimes the cause is unknown.Fortunately, there are many ways to treat pain.  Treatment varies depending on the cause of pain.  Pain relievers, acupuncture and sometimes surgery are helpful.'

S'If you\'ve ever groaned, "Oh, my aching back!", you are not alone. Back pain is one of the most common medical problems, affecting 8 out of 10 people at some point during their lives. Back pain can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain. \nAcute back pain comes on suddenly and usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Back pain is called chronic if it lasts for more than three months.Most back pain goes away on its own, though it may take awhile. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers and resting can help. However, staying in bed for more than 1 or 2 days can make it worse. If your back pain is severe or doesn\'t improve after three days, you should call your health care provider.  You should also get medical attention if you have back pain following an injury.Treatment for back pain depends on what kind of pain you have, and what is causing it. It may include hot or cold packs, exercise, medicines, injections, complementary treatments, and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases'

S"Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches, sore muscles, arthritis, or other aches and pains.  There are many different pain medicines, and each one has advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. There are two main types of OTC pain medicines: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are examples of OTC NSAIDs.If OTC medicines don't relieve your pain, your doctor may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The most powerful pain relievers are narcotics. They are very effective, but they can sometimes have serious side effects. Because of the risks, you must use them only under a doctor's supervision.There are many things you can do to help ease pain. Pain relievers are just one part of a pain treatment plan."

The pain may start somewhere else, such as your chest. Severe pain doesn't always mean a serious problem. Nor does mild pain mean a problem is not serious. Call your healthcare provider if mild pain lasts a week or more or if you have pain with other symptoms.

If the pain is severe, it might get in the way of your daily activities.If you're a woman, you might feel a dull pain during your period. It could also happen during sex.

S'Any part of your neck - muscles, bones, joints, tendons, ligaments, or nerves - can cause neck problems. Neck pain is very common. Pain may also come from your shoulder, jaw, head, or upper arms. Muscle strain or tension often causes neck pain. The problem is usually overuse, such as from sitting at a computer for too long.  Sometimes you can strain your neck muscles from sleeping in an awkward position or overdoing it during exercise. Falls or accidents, including car accidents, are another common cause of neck pain.  Whiplash, a soft tissue injury to the neck, is also called neck sprain or strain.Treatment depends on the cause, but may include applying ice, taking pain relievers, getting physical therapy or wearing a cervical collar. You rarely need surgery.'
