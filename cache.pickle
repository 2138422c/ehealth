S"Asthma is a chronic disease that affects your airways. Your airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen. That makes them very sensitive, and they may react strongly to things that you are allergic to or find irritating. When your airways react, they get narrower and your lungs get less air.Symptoms of asthma includeWheezingCoughing, especially early in the morning or at nightChest tightnessShortness of breathNot all people who have asthma have these symptoms. Having these symptoms doesn't always mean that you have asthma. Your doctor will diagnose asthma based on lung function tests, your medical history, and a physical exam. You may also have allergy tests.When your asthma symptoms become worse than usual, it's called an asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal.Asthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief medicines to stop asthma symptoms and long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms.

If you have asthma, the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen.In the United States, about 20 million people have asthma.  Nearly 9 million of them are children. Children have smaller airways than adults, which makes asthma especially serious for them. Children with asthma may experience wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and trouble breathing, especially early in the morning or at night. Many things can cause asthma, including Allergens - mold, pollen, animalsIrritants - cigarette smoke, air pollutionWeather - cold air, changes in weatherExercise Infections - flu, common coldWhen asthma symptoms become worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack.

In most allergic reactions, however, it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and the environment probably both play a role.Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rashes, swelling, or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to severe.  Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be life-threatening.   Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies.

S"Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body.   Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy, biologic therapy, or stem cell transplantation. NIH: National Cancer Institute"

S"Tumors are abnormal growths in your body. They are made up of extra cells. Normally, cells grow and divide to form new cells as your body needs them. When cells grow old, they die, and new cells take their place. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. New cells form when your body does not need them, and old cells do not die when they should. When these extra cells form a mass, it is called a tumor.Tumors can be either benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer. Malignant ones are. Benign tumors grow only in one place. They cannot spread or invade other parts of your body. Even so, they can be dangerous if they press on vital organs, such as your brain.Treatment often involves surgery.

S'Hives are red and sometimes itchy bumps on your skin. An allergic reaction to a drug or food usually causes them. Allergic reactions cause your body to release chemicals that can make your skin swell up in hives. People who have other allergies are more likely to get hives than other people.  Other causes include infections  and stress.Hives are very common.  They usually go away on their own, but if you have a serious case, you might need medicine or a shot. In rare cases, hives can cause a dangerous swelling in your airways, making it hard to breathe - which is a medical emergency.'

S'Most of the time, medicines make our lives better. They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions.One problem is interactions, which may occur betweenTwo drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinnersDrugs and food, such as statins and grapefruitDrugs and supplements, such as gingko and blood thinnersDrugs and diseases, such as aspirin and peptic ulcersInteractions can change the actions of one or both drugs.   The drugs might not work, or you could get side effects.Side effects are unwanted effects caused by the drugs.  Most are mild, such as a stomach aches or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the drug.  Others can be more serious.Drug allergies are another type of reaction.  They can be mild or life-threatening.  Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes, are the most common type. Anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction, is more rare.When you start a new prescription or over-the-counter medication, make sure you understand how to take it correctly.  Know which other medications and foods you need to avoid. Ask your health care provider or pharmacist if you have questions. '

Substances that often cause reactions arePollenDust mitesMold sporesPet danderFoodInsect stingsMedicinesNormally, your immune system fights germs. It is your body's defense system. In most allergic reactions, however, it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and the environment probably both play a role.Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rashes, swelling, or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to severe.  Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be life-threatening.   Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies.

S"A rash is an area of irritated or swollen skin. Many rashes are itchy, red, painful, and irritated. Some rashes can also lead to blisters or patches of raw skin.  Rashes are a symptom of many different medical problems. Other causes include irritating substances and allergies. Certain genes can make people more likely to get rashes.Contact dermatitis is a common type of rash. It causes redness, itching, and sometimes small bumps. You get the rash where you have touched an irritant, such as a chemical, or something you are allergic to, like poison ivy.Some rashes develop right away. Others form over several days. Although most rashes clear up fairly quickly, others are long-lasting and need  long-term treatment.Because rashes can be caused by many different things, it's important to figure out what kind you have before you treat it. If it is a bad rash, if it does not go away, or if you have other symptoms, you should see your health care provider. Treatments may include moisturizers, lotions, baths, cortisone creams that relieve swelling, and antihistamines, which relieve itching."

S'If you\'ve ever groaned, "Oh, my aching back!", you are not alone. Back pain is one of the most common medical problems, affecting 8 out of 10 people at some point during their lives. Back pain can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain. \nAcute back pain comes on suddenly and usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Back pain is called chronic if it lasts for more than three months.Most back pain goes away on its own, though it may take awhile. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers and resting can help. However, staying in bed for more than 1 or 2 days can make it worse. If your back pain is severe or doesn\'t improve after three days, you should call your health care provider.  You should also get medical attention if you have back pain following an injury.Treatment for back pain depends on what kind of pain you have, and what is causing it. It may include hot or cold packs, exercise, medicines, injections, complementary treatments, and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases'

S'Your backbone, or spine, is made up of 26 bones called vertebrae. In between them are soft disks filled with a jelly-like substance. These disks cushion the vertebrae and keep them in place. As you age, the disks break down or degenerate. As they do, they lose their cushioning ability. This can lead to pain if the back is stressed.A herniated disk is a disk that ruptures. This allows the jelly-like center of the disk to leak, irritating the nearby nerves. This can cause sciatica or back pain.Your doctor will diagnose a herniated disk with a physical exam and, sometimes, imaging tests. With treatment, most people recover. Treatments include rest, pain and anti-inflammatory medicines, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases'

S"Sciatica is a symptom of a problem with the sciatic nerve, the largest nerve in the body. It controls muscles in the back of your knee and lower leg and provides feeling to the back of your thigh, part of your lower leg, and the sole of your foot. When you have sciatica, you have pain, weakness, numbness, or tingling. It can start in the lower back and extend down your leg to your calf, foot, or even your toes. It's usually on only one side of your body.Causes of sciatica includeA ruptured intervertebral diskNarrowing of the spinal canal that puts pressure on the nerve, called spinal stenosisAn injury such as a pelvic fracture.In many cases no cause can be found.Sometimes sciatica goes away on its own. Treatment, if needed, depends on the cause of the problem. It may include exercises, medicines, and surgery."

S'Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis of the spine. It causes inflammation between your vertebrae, which are the bones that make up your spine, and in the joints between your spine and pelvis. In some people, it can affect other joints.AS is more common and more severe in men. It often runs in families. The cause is unknown, but it is likely that both genes and factors in the environment play a role.Early symptoms of AS include back pain and stiffness. These problems often start in late adolescence or early adulthood. Over time, AS can fuse your vertebrae together, limiting movement. Some people have symptoms that come and go. Others have severe, ongoing pain.A diagnosis of AS is based on your medical history and a physical examination. You may also have imaging or blood tests.AS has no cure, but medicines can relieve symptoms and may keep the disease from getting worse. Eating a healthy diet, not smoking, and exercising can also help. In rare cases, you may need surgery to straighten the spine.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease'

S"Shingles is a disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus - the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have chickenpox, the virus stays in your body. It may not cause problems for many years.  As you get older, the virus may reappear as shingles. Although it is most common in people over age 50, anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk.You can't catch shingles from someone who has it.  However, if you have a shingles rash, you can pass the virus to someone who has never had chickenpox.  This would usually be a child, who could get chickenpox instead of shingles.  The virus spreads through direct contact with the rash, and cannot spread through the air.Early signs of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching, usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe. Rashes or blisters appear anywhere from one to 14 days later. If shingles appears on your face, it may affect your vision or hearing. The pain of shingles may last for weeks, months, or even years after the blisters have healed. There is no cure for shingles. Early treatment with medicines that fight the virus may help. These medicines may also help prevent lingering pain.A vaccine may prevent shingles or lessen its effects.  The vaccine is recommended for people 60 or over.  In some cases doctors may give it to people ages 50 to 59.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"

S'Your eyes can get infections from bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Eye infections can occur in different parts of the eye and can affect just one eye or both. Two common eye infections are\tConjunctivitis - also known as pinkeye. Conjunctivitis is often due to an infection. Children frequently get it, and it is very contagious. Stye - a bump on the eyelid that happens when bacteria from your skin get into the hair follicle of an eyelash.Symptoms of eye infections may include redness, itching, swelling, discharge, pain, or problems with vision. Treatment depends on the cause of the infection and may include compresses, eye drops, creams, or antibiotics.'

S'Herpes is an infection that is caused by a herpes simplex virus (HSV). Oral herpes causes cold sores around the mouth or face.  Genital herpes affects the genitals, buttocks or anal area.  Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease (STD). It affects the genitals, buttocks or anal area. Other herpes infections can affect the eyes, skin, or other parts of the body. The virus can be dangerous in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems. There are two types of HSV:HSV type 1 most commonly causes cold sores. It can also cause genital herpes.HSV type 2 is the usual cause of genital herpes, but it also can infect the mouth.HSV spreads through direct contact. Some people have no symptoms. Others get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. They turn into blisters, become itchy and painful, and then heal.Most people have outbreaks several times a year. Over time, you get them less often. Medicines to help your body fight the virus can help lessen symptoms and decrease outbreaks.'

S'Chickenpox is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Most cases are in children under age 15, but older children and adults can get it.  It spreads very easily from one person to another.The classic symptom of chickenpox is an uncomfortable, itchy rash. The rash turns into fluid-filled blisters and eventually into scabs. It usually shows up on the face, chest, and back and then spreads to the rest of the body. Other symptoms includeFeverHeadacheTirednessLoss of appetiteChickenpox is usually mild and lasts 5 to 10 days. Calamine lotions and oatmeal baths can help with itching. Acetaminophen can treat the fever. Do not use aspirin for chickenpox; that combination can cause Reye syndrome.Chickenpox can sometimes cause serious problems. Adults, babies, teenagers, pregnant women, and those with weak immune systems tend to get sicker from it. They may need to take antiviral medicines.Once you catch chickenpox, the virus usually stays in your body.  You probably will not get chickenpox again, but the virus can cause shingles in adults. A chickenpox vaccine can help prevent most cases of chickenpox, or make it less severe if you do get it.Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'

S"Asthma is a chronic disease that affects your airways. Your airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the inside walls of your airways become sore and swollen. That makes them very sensitive, and they may react strongly to things that you are allergic to or find irritating. When your airways react, they get narrower and your lungs get less air.Symptoms of asthma includeWheezingCoughing, especially early in the morning or at nightChest tightnessShortness of breathNot all people who have asthma have these symptoms. Having these symptoms doesn't always mean that you have asthma. Your doctor will diagnose asthma based on lung function tests, your medical history, and a physical exam. You may also have allergy tests.When your asthma symptoms become worse than usual, it's called an asthma attack. Severe asthma attacks may require emergency care, and they can be fatal.Asthma is treated with two kinds of medicines: quick-relief medicines to stop asthma symptoms and long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms.

S'Viruses are capsules with genetic material inside. They are very tiny, much smaller than bacteria.  Viruses cause familiar infectious diseases such as the common cold, flu and warts. They also cause severe illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, smallpox and hemorrhagic fevers. Viruses are like hijackers. They invade living, normal cells and use those cells to multiply and produce other viruses like themselves. This eventually kills the cells, which can make you sick.Viral infections are hard to treat because viruses live inside your body\'s cells. They are "protected" from medicines, which usually move through your bloodstream.  Antibiotics do not work for viral infections. There are a few antiviral medicines available. Vaccines can help prevent you from getting many viral diseases.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases'

S"Having HIV/AIDS weakens your body's immune system. Your immune system normally fights germs \nthat enter your body. When HIV/AIDS makes it weak, it can't fight germs well. This can lead to \nserious infections that don't often affect healthy people. These are called opportunistic \ninfections (OIs).There are many types of OIs. Tuberculosis and a serious \nrelated disease,  Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) are bacterial infections. Viral infections include cytomegalovirus (CMV) and hepatitis C.  Fungi cause thrush (candidiasis), \ncryptococcal meningitis, pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) \nand histoplasmosis, and parasites cause crypto (cryptosporidiosis) and toxo (toxoplasmosis).Having HIV/AIDS can make any infection harder to treat. People with AIDS are also more \nlikely to suffer complications of common illnesses such as the flu. The good news is that you can help prevent infections by taking your HIV/AIDS medicines. Other things that can help include practicing safe sex, \nwashing your hands well and often and cooking your food well. "

S'Pain is a feeling triggered in the nervous system. Pain may be sharp or dull.  It may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your back, abdomen or chest or you may feel pain all over, such as when your muscles ache from the flu.Pain can be helpful in diagnosing a problem.  Without pain, you might seriously hurt yourself without knowing it, or you might not realize you have a medical problem that needs treatment.  Once you take care of the problem, pain usually goes away.  However, sometimes pain goes on for weeks, months or even years.  This is called chronic pain.  Sometimes chronic pain is due to an ongoing cause, such as cancer or arthritis. Sometimes the cause is unknown.Fortunately, there are many ways to treat pain.  Treatment varies depending on the cause of pain.  Pain relievers, acupuncture and sometimes surgery are helpful.'

S'If you\'ve ever groaned, "Oh, my aching back!", you are not alone. Back pain is one of the most common medical problems, affecting 8 out of 10 people at some point during their lives. Back pain can range from a dull, constant ache to a sudden, sharp pain. \nAcute back pain comes on suddenly and usually lasts from a few days to a few weeks. Back pain is called chronic if it lasts for more than three months.Most back pain goes away on its own, though it may take awhile. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers and resting can help. However, staying in bed for more than 1 or 2 days can make it worse. If your back pain is severe or doesn\'t improve after three days, you should call your health care provider.  You should also get medical attention if you have back pain following an injury.Treatment for back pain depends on what kind of pain you have, and what is causing it. It may include hot or cold packs, exercise, medicines, injections, complementary treatments, and sometimes surgery.NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases'

S"Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve headaches, sore muscles, arthritis, or other aches and pains.  There are many different pain medicines, and each one has advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever. Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. There are two main types of OTC pain medicines: acetaminophen (Tylenol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) are examples of OTC NSAIDs.If OTC medicines don't relieve your pain, your doctor may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses. The most powerful pain relievers are narcotics. They are very effective, but they can sometimes have serious side effects. Because of the risks, you must use them only under a doctor's supervision.There are many things you can do to help ease pain. Pain relievers are just one part of a pain treatment plan."

Muscle strain or tension often causes neck pain. The problem is usually overuse, such as from sitting at a computer for too long.  Sometimes you can strain your neck muscles from sleeping in an awkward position or overdoing it during exercise. Falls or accidents, including car accidents, are another common cause of neck pain.  Whiplash, a soft tissue injury to the neck, is also called neck sprain or strain.Treatment depends on the cause, but may include applying ice, taking pain relievers, getting physical therapy or wearing a cervical collar.

S"An allergy is a reaction by your immune system to something that does not bother most other people. People who have allergies often are sensitive to more than one thing. Substances that often cause reactions arePollenDust mitesMold sporesPet danderFoodInsect stingsMedicinesNormally, your immune system fights germs. It is your body's defense system. In most allergic reactions, however, it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and the environment probably both play a role.Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rashes, swelling, or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to severe.  Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction that can be life-threatening.   Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies. Treatments include medicines, allergy shots, and avoiding the substances that cause the reactions.NIH: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases"

In the course of a year, people in the United States suffer 1 billion colds.\nWhat can you do for your cold or cough symptoms? Besides drinking plenty of fluids and getting plenty of rest, you may want to take medicines. There are lots of different cold and cough medicines, and they do different things.Nasal decongestants - unclog a stuffy noseCough suppressants - quiet a coughExpectorants - loosen mucus so you can cough it up Antihistamines - stop runny noses and sneezingPain relievers - ease fever, headaches, and minor aches and painsHere are some other things to keep in mind about cold and cough medicines.  Read labels, because many cold and cough medicines contain the same active ingredients. Taking too much of certain pain relievers can lead to serious injury. Do not give cough medicines to children under four, and don't give aspirin to children.    Finally, antibiotics won't help a cold.Food and Drug Administration"

S'Your nose is important to your health. It filters the air you breathe, removing dust, germs, and irritants. It warms and moistens the air to keep your lungs and tubes that lead to them from drying out. Your nose also contains the nerve cells that help your sense of smell. When there is a problem with your nose, your whole body can suffer. For example, the stuffy nose of the common cold can make it hard for you to breathe, sleep, or get comfortable. Many problems besides the common cold can affect the nose. They include\tDeviated septum - a shifting of the wall that divides the nasal cavity into halves\tNasal polyps - soft growths that develop on the lining of your nose or sinuses\tNosebleeds \tRhinitis - inflammation of the nose and sinuses sometimes caused by allergies. The main symptom is a runny nose.Nasal fractures, also known as a broken nose'

S'Urinary incontinence (UI) is loss of bladder control. Symptoms can range from mild leaking to uncontrollable wetting. It can happen to anyone, but it becomes more common with age. Women experience UI twice as often as men.Most bladder control problems happen when muscles are too weak or too active. If the muscles that keep your bladder closed are weak, you may have accidents when you sneeze, laugh or lift a heavy object. This is stress incontinence. If bladder muscles become too active, you may feel a strong urge to go to the bathroom when you have little urine in your bladder. This is urge incontinence or overactive bladder.  There are other causes of incontinence, such as prostate problems and nerve damage.Treatment depends on the type of problem you have and what best fits your lifestyle. It may include simple exercises, medicines, special devices or procedures prescribed by your doctor, or surgery. NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases'
